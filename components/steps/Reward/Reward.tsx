            YES! You did it, the file is now unlocked! Oh man! These beavers are
            going crazy, they are just buzzing with activity! They seem to be
            progressing at a breakneck speed! Sadly, I canâ€™t quite find anything
            in here that would help us get out, but maybeâ€¦ If we stay here for a
            whileâ€¦ With a bit of guidance, Iâ€™m sure these beavers could achieve
            technological levels they never even dreamt of! That could be our
            way out, and either way, Dipper and Mabel seem to enjoy their
            company quite a lot.
